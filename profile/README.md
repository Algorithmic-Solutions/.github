Welcome to my repository dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of algorithms and data structures! This is a personal project where I document my self-learning journey, providing code samples and detailed explanations in an article-style format.

**What You'll Find Here:**

* **A Compendium of Algorithms:**  Explore implementations for various algorithms, including sorting, searching, string manipulation, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. 
* **Data Structures Demystified:** Dive into explanations and practical code examples of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
* **Clear and Concise Explanations:** Each "article" strives to present complex concepts in a clear and understandable manner, making them accessible to learners of all levels.

**Learning by Doing:**

This repository reflects my self-learning process. As I learn new algorithms and data structures, I document them here with clear explanations and practical implementations. This approach helps me solidify my understanding and allows others to benefit from my journey. 

**Continuous Exploration:**

This repository is a work in progress. I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge base. As I explore new concepts, I will continue to add relevant articles and code examples. 

**Feel free to:**

* **[Browse the repository](https://github.com/m-mdy-m/algorithms-data-structures):** Explore the available articles on algorithms and data structures.
* **Fork and contribute:** If you have suggestions or corrections, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
